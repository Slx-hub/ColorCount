# ColorCount

This Project analyzes incoming images and estimates how much it would cost to build every pixel with Lego.

Bag sizes and cost are currently hardcoded.

Future additions might include:

- Keeping an inventory of current owned Lego pixels and including them in the estimation
- Settings for changing real world parameters
